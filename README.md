Example data integration


I have created this repository to provide an example of data integration.


Goal.


Ingest data from some arbitrary website and an API on a schedule, land it to blob or whatever.
Grab that data in a function or some other thing like data factory and transform it with a function or stored procedure then land it into an SQL database on an Azure server instance.
Build all the YAML to deploy this magical pipeline of wonder. 
Create all the relevant documentation detailing the logic for the transformations etc.
